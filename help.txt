h3(#preferences-pane). Preferences pane

Rah_unlog_me will add two new options to Textpattern's Preferences pane, found at /Textpattern/Admin/Preferences; _an option to automatically exclude site authors' IPs_ and a field to define _a list of additional IPs to exclude_.

h4(#pref-auto). Exclude site authors' IPs from the logs?

If the first option, _Exclude site authors' IPs from the logs?_ is set to _Yes_, IPs of admins are removed from the logs when the user logs in to Textpattern's backend.

h4(#pref-ip). Comma separated list of additional IPs to exclude from the logs

The second option of rah_unlog_me is a field where you can define a list of IPs which will be excluded from the logs. You can define as many IPs as you want. Use commas (@,@) to separate multiple IPs.
