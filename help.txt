h3(#installation-and-usage). Installation and usage

p. The general behavior stands when it comes to installing rah_unlog_me.

* Navigate to Plugins pane: TXP/Admin/Plugins.

 and run the automatic setup by clicking the _Upload_ button.
* When all done, just active the plugin on the plugin list and you are ready to use rah_unlog_me's additional options.

p. You can find rah_unlog_me's preferences from Textpattern's preferences panel (Admin/Preferences), next to other logging related preferences.

h3(#preferences-pane). Preferences pane

Rah_unlog_me will add two new options to Textpattern's Preferences pane (found at Textpattern/Admin/Preferences); _an option to automatically exclude site authors' IPs_ and a field to define _a list of additional IPs to filter out_.

h4. Exclude site authors' IPs from the logs?

If the first option, _Exclude site authors' IPs from the logs?_ is set to _Yes_, site admins' IPs are removed from the visitor logs when the users visit Textpattern's backend.

h4. Comma separated list of additional IPs to exclude from the logs

The second option of rah_unlog_me is a field where you can define a list of IPs which will be excluded from the logs. You can define as many IPs as you want. Use commas (@,@) to separate multiple IPs.

h3(#changelog). Changelog

p. *Version 1.3*

* Changed: Use the exact same method as Textpattern to check logged in user's IP. Just for consistency, doesn't really affect anything.
* Removed: JavaScript on Preferences panel. Causes more issues than adds. Not everyone wants everyone to navigate to the plugin's pane.

p. *Version 1.2*

* Don't throw up JavaScript to top of Preferences pane when JavaScript is disabled.
* Sweep pre-defined list of IPs with a single query.

p. *Version 1.1*

* Fixed typo in the uninstaller. Called step from "delete" to "deleted".
* Added forgotten flags.
* Added missing privileges for the plugins pane's options link.
* Fixed typo in docs. Changed required TXP version from 4.0.7 to 4.2.0.

p. *Version 1.0*

* Integrated plugin's preferences to Textpattern's native preferences pane.
* Better excluding/removing script. No longer searches IPs from the logs if it doesn't need to; takes no action when logs are off, and removes the additional IPs from logs only when accessing the logs pane.
* Language string support.
* Now requires TXP 4.2.0 for full feature support.

p. *Version 0.1*

* First release
