h2. Preferences

p. Rah_unlog_me will add couple new options to Textpattern's "Preferences panel":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Basic_Preferences. These include an option to automatically exclude admins from logs and a field to define a list of additional IPs to filter out. The options are as follows.

h3. Exclude site authors' IPs from the logs?

p. If set to _Yes_, site admins' IP addresses are removed from the visitor logs when the users logs in to Textpattern control panel.

h3. Additional IPs to exclude from the logs (comma-separated)

p. The second option of rah_unlog_me is a field where you can define a comma-separated (@,@) list of IPs which will be excluded from the logs.

p. This option supports wildcards. @%@ matches any number of characters, and @_@ matches exactly one character. With the wildcards it's easy to exclude whole address blocks. Following would exclude local devices from the logs:

bc. ::_%, fc00::_%, 10._%, 127._%, 172.16._%, 192.168.0._%
